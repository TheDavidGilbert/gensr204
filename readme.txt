Generic Staff Roster        Readme Text File, Version 2.1

---------------------------------------------------------
General Purpose of GSR (Generic Staff Roster)

GSR  was  designed  to aid in the development  of  weekly
staff  rosters  for small business owners/managers.   GSR
has  the  ability  to produce reports which  details  any
potential conflicts or problems found with your  rosters.
It   can  also  produce  very  basic  staff/roster   cost
breakdown reports.

---------------------------------------------------------
Installation

Unzip the  GSR201.ZIP  file  to  a temporary directory on
your  hard drive.  From within  Windows, double-click the 
'setup.exe'  from your  file manager (or Windows Explorer 
for Windows 95 users).  Follow the prompts to install GSR
to your hard drive (the default installation directory is
C:\GSR).
---------------------------------------------------------
System Requirements

GSR requires Windows 3.1 or higher,  mouse and a graphics
capable   printer.  Installation  requires  approximately
3.5mb free disk space.

GSR and the concept of Shareware

GSR  is shareware. That means that you can download,  use
and completely free test the program for a certain period
(normally  30-45  days). You may  also  freely  copy  and
distribute  GSR  to others as long as the  files  in  the
original GSR201.ZIP archive are not tampered with and  no
fee  is  charged. If you find the program useful and  you
continue to use it, you are obligated to register.

*********************************************************
** to register, use  the register.txt file  in the GSR **
** directory                                           **
*********************************************************

The  whole  shareware concept is based  on  honesty.  The
registration  fee  you  pay  allows  me  to  support  and
continue to develop GSR in the future.

When  you  register  GSR you will  get  the  most  recent
registered version of the program, email support and  the
registered version help file along with constant  updates
about further developments in GSR and free upgrades.
