Generic Staff Roster            Users Guide, Version 2.1

 Welcome  to  the Users Guide for Generic  Staff  Roster
 (hereafter referred to as GSR).  While GSR is still  in
 development, this document will serve as a  'manual  by
 proxy' so to speak until the full manual and help  file
 have  been completed.  These will be available to those
 users who register the program with the author.

Section 1.     General Overview

GSR  was  designed  to aid in the development  of  weekly
staff  rosters  for small business owners/managers.   GSR
has  the  ability  to  produce reports which  detail  any
potential conflicts or problems found with your  rosters.
It   can  also  produce  very  basic  staff/roster   cost
breakdown reports.

GSR is composed of four main elements.  These are:

The Control Form

          The  control form has several functions.  These
          are:
          - allow modification of each roster description
            and code
          - allow    activation   or   deactivation    of
            individual rosters
          - adjust parameters of new rosters (start time,
            end time, interval)
          - select  the starting day of the week  (Sunday
            through to Saturday)
          - toggle delete confirmation
          - delete all rosters
       
The Staff Form

          The  staff form allows you to modify your staff
          member  list.  On this form, you  can  add  new
          staff  members and their details, edit  details
          for  existing staff members and delete obsolete
          staff records.
       
The Roster Form

          The   roster  form  is  your  roster   creation
          workspace.  Here you can:
          - adjust times for each shift in the roster
          - add staff members to individual time slots
          - remove  staff  members from  individual  time
            slots
          - print the selected roster
          - edit notes for the selected roster
       
The Main Window

          The  main  window contains all of the  previous
          forms.  It also provides a toolbar (at the  top
          of the form) and a status bar (at the bottom of
          the form).  The toolbar contains buttons to:
          - show  or  hide the staff, roster and  control
            forms
          - print the selected form (if applicable)
          - change the font for the selected item
          - produce the roster Exception Report
          - produce the staff/roster detail report
       
          Located at the bottom of the main window is the
          status    bar.    The   status   bar   contains
          information   about  the   operation   of   GSR
          (generally  whichever control the mouse  cursor
          is  over).   Messages  about  the  function  of
          certain controls and particular operations will
          be displayed here.
          
          Both  the  toolbar and the status  bar  can  be
          switched on and off by using the `Options' menu
          item.

Rosters and Shifts

A  roster is made up of seven days (starting with the day
specified on the control form).  Each roster can  contain
an  almost unlimited number of shifts.  A shift comprises
a  start  time and a finish time.  A roster may  also  be
called  a  'classification' or 'class'.  This is  because
you   can  allocate  staff  members  to  various  rosters
according  to  their classification.  This  is  explained
further in the section on the Staff form.

---------------------------------------------------------
Section 2.     Getting Started

The Control Form

The  first  task  which  you  should  concentrate  on  is
defining  the  rosters  or classes  which  your  business
requires.  This is done on the control form.  On the left
hand  side  of  the  control form is a  grid  with  three
columns.   Initially,  this  grid  will  be  filled  with
default values and all rosters will be enabled.

       1. Double-click   on   the  first   cell   in   the
          'Description'  column and  a  class  definition
          text box will popup.
       
       2. Type  in up to 20 alphanumeric characters  as  a
          description  for this roster.   You  might  use
          'Counter' as an example of a counter roster for
          a small cafe.  Click on the OK button to accept
          this description.
       
       3. Now  double-click  on  the  first  cell  in  the
          'Code'  column.  Again, a text box  will  popup
          asking  for  a  short  code  to  identify  this
          roster.

       4. Type  up  to  three alphanumeric  characters  in
          this box and click OK.  You might type 'COU' as
          the  short form for the counter roster  example
          from step 2.

       5. Double-clicking  on the small LED  icon  in  the
          third   column   will   activate   (green)   or
          deactivate  (red) the roster.  This means  that
          the roster will not be available for editing on
          the roster form, or searched when exception  or
          staff reports are produced.
  
       Tip:  Disabling  all unnecessary  rosters  will
       speed up the reporting process.

       6. Repeat  steps 1 to 5 on subsequent lines of  the
          grid   until  you  have  entered  all  required
          rosters.   GSR  can  handle up  to  ten  roster
          definitions.   (This  may  change   in   future
          versions).

       7. Click  on the drop down box under 'Starting  Day
          of  Week' and select the day which starts  your
          roster.

       8. Select  the  appropriate roster  increment  from
          the  'Roster  Increment' drop down  box.   This
          increment  will only be used if you  decide  to
          auto-generate a roster using the button on  the
          roster form.

       9. If  you decide to auto-generate your rosters (if
          you  use standard times and increments for your
          shifts),  click on 'Start Time' and select  the
          starting hour and minute from the two drop down
          boxes  to  the left.  Click on 'End  Time'  and
          repeat this procedure.

       10.The  'Start  Date' box contains  the  date
          which  will be printed on staff rosters.  Enter
          the  starting date of the roster here, or click
          on the button marked '(Today)' to place today's
          date in the box.

       11.Make sure the 'Delete Confirmation' box is
          checked  if  you  want to be asked  to  confirm
          every  time you delete a staff member or roster
          item.
       
The Staff Form

After  you  have  defined all of the  rosters  which  you
require, you need to enter your staff details.

Select  the  staff form.  There will be a  default  staff
member already entered in the list, with the details  for
this employee displayed to the right.  You can edit these
details by clicking in the appropriate box and typing  in
the  new  details.  If you make any changes  to  a  staff
record,  the 'save' button becomes visible on  the  staff
toolbar.  This button has a small floppy disk icon on it.
Click on this button to save any changes you have made to
this  staff member.  The  'exclamation point'  button  on
the  staff  toolbar is used to add a new staff member  to
the  list, while the 'scissors' button is used to  delete
the highlighted staff member from the list.

Most of the staff details are self explanatory, but a few
warrant further investigations.

Staff  ID:  this  field  should contain  a  UNIQUE  staff
alphanumeric code to identify each staff member.   It  is
printed on each individual staff roster.

Birth  Date  and  Date  Employed: these  fields  are  not
required  but  if  they are entered,  'age'  and  'period
employed'  information  will  be  displayed  beside   the
respective fields.

Hours  Min  and Hours Max: these values are not required,
but if entered, they will be used in the Exception Report
to  catch allocated hours which fall outside this  range.
For  example, John Citizen has 'Hours Min' set to 24  and
'Hours  Max'  set  to  42.  If he is allocated  45  hours
during  the week, an exception will be reported when  the
Exception  Report  is  produced.   This  is  useful  when
certain  staff members (e.g.: students) cannot work  more
than  a  set number of hours a week in case it interferes
with their study allowance/assistance.

Notes:  the  notes box allows you to enter any reminders,
messages etc for the selected staff member.  This note is
then printed on their individual weekly staff roster.

Staff  Classification: The rosters which you  entered  in
the  control form will appear hear in a check  box  list.
By  checking a roster, you are making the selected  staff
member  available to this roster.  In the example  above,
John  Citizen is available to be allocated to the Counter
and Supervisor rosters.  His name will not appear next to
the other rosters on the roster form.

Staff  Availability: Click the toggle button (the  button
with  the  red  circle  and yellow  triangle)  to  switch
between  the  Staff Classification frame  and  the  Staff
Availability frame.  A list of days starting with the day
specified  on the control form will appear  and  you  can
check  the  days  which  the  selected  staff  member  is
available  on.   This  is a safety  measure  designed  to
eliminate  staff  being  assigned  to  days  they  cannot
regularly  work.  The two buttons at the  bottom  of  the
frame  allow  you  to  select all or  none  of  the  days
quickly.   Allocating staff to days for  which  they  are
unavailable on the roster form will result in  a  message
box   appearing,   indicating  that   staff   member   is
unavailable on the assigned day.

Both  the  Staff  Classification and  Staff  Availability
settings are used when the Exception Report is produced.

The last two icons on the Staff toolbar are used to print
staff  rosters.   The  first button (the  button  with  a
single  person icon) will print a weekly roster  for  the
selected staff member while the second button (the button
with  a  multiple person icon) will print a weekly roster
for all staff members who appear in rosters.

The Roster Form

The roster form is where you will spend most of your time
once  you  have set up your staff list.  The roster  form
consists of:

       - a  dropdown  list box containing a list  of  all
          active  rosters (those rosters whose LED  light
          is green on the control form)
       - a  staff  list box, containing all staff members
          who can be assigned to the selected roster (the
          checkbox for the roster is checked on the staff
          form)
       - a  spreadsheet-type  grid where  the  roster  is
          defined
       - a small toolbar
       
By clicking on the dropdown list box, you can select from
the  list of rosters which you have marked active.  After
selection, the roster (if already defined) will appear in
the  spreadsheet  grid and a list of all available  staff
members  for  this roster will appear in the  staff  list
box.

Once  you have selected the desired roster, you can begin
to  modify it.  Your first roster will require  at  least
one  shift,  with a start time and a finish time.   There
are two ways of creating a new roster.

1.You  can  click the auto-generate button on the  roster
  toolbar (the little triangle with the lightning  bolt).
  This will build a new roster using the defaults on  the
  control form.  It will start with the designated  start
  time  and  build  shifts with the  increment  specified
  until the end time is reached.  This method is of  most
  use when your shifts are of uniform length.

2.If  your roster shifts are somewhat less uniform,  then
  you  can  define the shifts yourself.  Select  a  blank
  line  on  the roster and double-click the first column.
  A  small  dialog box will popup allowing you to  select
  the  starting  hour and minute for this shift.   Select
  the  appropriate  time  and press  'OK'.   Repeat  this
  process  in the second column to create the  end  time.
  To  create more shifts, click on the 'plus' button next
  to  the  roster grid and a new row will be inserted  in
  the  grid.  The 'minus' button next to the roster  grid
  will  remove  the selected row from the grid.   Double-
  clicking  on a grid cell with a time value in  it  will
  enable you to modify that time.

Now that you have the roster shifts set, you can begin to
allocate staff members.  The easiest way to perform  this
task is:

1.Highlight  the desired shift on the roster spreadsheet.
  Tip:  You  can highlight more than one cell by clicking
  and  holding  the left mouse button while dragging  the
  mouse cursor.  Use this method to select the same shift
  across several days.

2.Select  the staff member to be assigned to this  shift.
  Tip:  You  can highlight more than one staff member  by
  clicking  and  holding  the  left  mouse  button  while
  dragging  the mouse cursor.  Hold down the control  key
  and   left-click  to  select/deselect  multiple   staff
  members.

3.If you have selected a single staff member to transfer,
  double-click  the staff name and it will be  placed  in
  the  appropriate cell(s) in the roster.  If  the  staff
  member  is unavailable for that day, a dialog box  will
  popup and tell you so.

4.If   you  have  selected  multiple  staff  members   to
  transfer,  click  on the right arrow button  above  the
  roster selection box (the button with the blue triangle
  pointing  to the right).  This will transfer all  staff
  members  into the selected roster cell(s).  If a  staff
  member  is unavailable for that day, a dialog box  will
  popup and tell you so.

5.To  remove  a  staff  member from a shift,  select  the
  roster  cell(s)  and  double-click the  staff  member's
  name.

6.To  remove  multiple staff members, select  the  roster
  cell(s) and multi-select the names of the staff members
  you  wish  to  remove, then click upon the  left  arrow
  button above the roster selection box (the button  with
  the blue triangle pointing to the left).

7.Staff names can not be added to the same shift twice.

                                       The Roster Toolbar
                                                         
1.Delete  -  delete the entire contents of  the  selected
  cell.

2.Save  -  save  any  changes made to this  roster  (this
  button is only visible after changes have been made  to
  the current roster).

3.Copy - copy the selected roster cells to the clipboard.
  Use  this  in  conjunction with the  paste  command  to
  duplicate sections of the roster.

4.Paste  -  paste the contents of the clipboard into  the
  selected roster cells.  This command works best if  the
  paste  area  is  the same size as the  copy  area  was.
  Note: this command will not paste multiple names

5.Notes.-  edit notes for the currently selected  roster.
  These notes will be printed on the roster printout.

---------------------------------------------------------
Section 3.     Advanced Topics

Printing Rosters

To  print  a roster, select the desired roster  from  the
roster selection box and click the printer button on  the
main  form  toolbar (the button with the  printer  icon).
This will print the current full-week roster, setting the
start  date  to  that defined on the control  form.   Any
notes  for this roster will be printed at the end of  the
report.

Printing Timesheets

You  can print individual timesheets for a selected staff
member,  or  all timesheets for those staff  members  who
have  been  assigned  to  rosters.   These  buttons   are
available on the staff form toolbar.

The  first button (the button with a single person  icon)
will  print a weekly roster for the selected staff member
while  the  second  button (the button  with  a  multiple
person  icon)  will print a weekly roster for  all  staff
members  who  appear in rosters.  These  timesheets  will
include  any notes entered for that staff member.   If  a
staff  member hasn't been allocated to a roster, no  time
sheet will be printed.

Producing Reports

The report functions in GSR are useful tools for reducing
roster  errors.   The report buttons are located  on  the
main form toolbar.

                                     The Exception Report
                                                         
Clicking  on  the  left  button  (the  button  with   the
magnifying   glass  icon)  will  produce  the  `Exception
Report'.  The Exception Report will provide the most help
when building your rosters.  You should use it after  you
have  finished  your initial staff to roster  allocation.
Because  this  report  has  to cycle  through  all  staff
records   and   active  rosters  and   perform   multiple
comparisons,  it  may  take a  few  minutes  to  complete
(depending  upon the number of records and the  processor
type  and memory capacity of the computer you are using).
This report details:

- any  staff  conflicts  across rosters,  where  a  staff
  member   may  be  allocated  to  multiple  rosters   on
  overlapping shifts

- unavailable  staff  members,  where  staff  have   been
  allocated  on  days  which they are now  not  available
  (possibly on holiday, changed work hours etc)

- incorrect  staff class, where staff have been allocated
  to  rosters  which  they  are  now  not  available  for
  (promoted, relieved of duties)

- staff  member not in staff list, where a name was found
  in  the roster and no corresponding staff member exists
  in   the  staff  list  (staff  member  retired,   quit,
  employment terminated, changed name)

- allocation  of  hours incorrect, where a  staff  member
  requires certain hours and these requirements have  not
  been met (too many hours, too few hours)

The report is shown in a spreadsheet grid similar to that
of the roster, with the exceptions listed in the order in
which  they were found (normally staff member X roster  X
time).   You  can  send this report  to  the  printer  by
clicking  on  the printer icon on the main form  toolbar.
This report shows:

1.an  LED  to indicate the severity of the problem  (red,
  yellow   or  green  -  the  color  is  only   a   basic
  interpretation   of  the  possible  eventualities   the
  exception may cause)
2.the roster name where the problem occurred
3.the roster day and the
4.shift start time when the problem occurred
5.the staff member involved with the exception and
6.a brief description of the problem.

Tip:  You can double-click on an exception listed in  the
report  to be taken to the source of the problem - either
the  roster  form or the staff list - with the  offending
roster cell or staff member record highlighted.


The Staff Report

Clicking  on the right button (the button with the  faces
icon)  will produce the `Staff Report'.  The Staff Report
is  most useful when you have allocated all of your staff
to  roster  shifts.  Because this  report  has  to  cycle
through  all staff records and active rosters and perform
multiple  comparisons,  it may  take  a  few  minutes  to
complete  (depending upon the number of records  and  the
processor  type and memory capacity of the  computer  you
are using). This report details:

- total  hours and currency amounts for each staff member
  broken  down into each roster to which the staff member
  has been allocated

- grand  total figures for each roster and absolute grand
  totals for all rosters

Note:  if  a staff member hasn't been assigned an  hourly
rate,  currency amounts will not be calculated for  them.
You  can enter an hourly amount for a staff member on the
staff form

The report is shown in a spreadsheet grid similar to that
of  the roster, with staff members listed in alphabetical
order and then broken down by roster.  You can send  this
report to the printer by clicking on the printer icon  on
the main form toolbar.  This report shows:

1.the staff members staff ID
2.the staff members name
3.the  roster name applicable to the displayed hours  and
  amount
4.the  hours  for the specified roster (with total  hours
  underneath for each staff member and a grand  total  at
  the end of the report)
5.the  total  currency  amount for the  specified  roster
  (with total amount underneath for each staff member and
  a grand total at the end of the report)
6.a  breakdown  of  hours and currency amounts  for  each
  roster at the end of the report


More About the Reports

The  report form toolbar contains a query button (with  a
question  mark icon).  Click on this button to view  more
information  about  the highlighted  exception  or  staff
report.


Saving and Loading Files

The  `File' menu on the GSR main form allows you to  save
the  current roster to a file and load a previously saved
roster.

                      Saving the Current Roster to a File
                                                         
Selecting `Save Roster to File' from the `File' menu will
bring  up  the save file dialog.  The save file  name  is
initially the current roster start date (specified on the
control  form)  with  the  extension  being  the   roster
identifier  code  (also specified on the  control  form).
The roster is saved in comma-delimited text format.

                          Loading a Previously Saved File
                                                         
Selecting  `Load Roster from File' from the  `File'  menu
will  bring up the open file dialog.  You can select  the
type  of roster file to open by clicking on the drop down
list  box  .   All  of the active roster  types  will  be
listed.   You can also select `all files (*.*)' and  `all
text  files (*.txt)'.  Select a roster name from the file
list  and press `OK'.  Saved rosters are loaded into  the
corresponding  roster  spreadsheet.   If  there   is   no
corresponding roster spreadsheet, the roster file will be
loaded into the current roster grid.  For example, if you
are loading a saved `Counter' roster, GSR will switch  to
the   `Counter'  roster  on  the  roster  form.   If  the
`Counter'  roster  isn't available or active,  the  saved
`Counter'  roster  will  be  loaded  into  the  currently
displayed roster spreadsheet.

Note:  the  loaded roster isn't made permanent until  you
have  made  changes to it and clicked the save button  on
the roster form toolbar.  If you switch rosters using the
roster form drop down list on the roster form, the loaded
file details will be lost.

Options

                                           Changing Fonts
                                                         
You  can select the font type with which certain controls
display data (such as the roster grid) by clicking on the
font button on the main form toolbar (the button with the
blue `A' icon).  If applicable, the font in the currently
highlighted  control will be changed to  that  which  you
selected.   You  can  only change  the  display  font  in
certain  controls - grids, list boxes etc.  This  display
font also applies to printed objects, such as rosters and
reports.

                                Changing Printer Settings

'Hide Toolbar' from the 'Options' menu.  The toolbar can
be made visible again by selecting 'Show Toolbar' from the
'Options' menu.  The same is applicable for the main form

scroll), select 'Lock Roster Columns' from the 'Options'

Section 4.     System Requirements

GSR requires Windows 3.1or higher, a mouse and a graphics
capable   printer.  Installation  requires  approximately
2.5mb free disk space.

---------------------------------------------------------
Section 5.     GSR and the concept of Shareware

GSR  is shareware. That means that you can download,  use
and completely free test the program for a certain period
(normally  30-45  days). You may  also  freely  copy  and
distribute  GSR  to others as long as the  files  in  the
original GSR201.ZIP archive are not tampered with and  no
fee  is  charged. If you find the program useful and  you
continue to use it, you are obligated to register.

The  whole  shareware concept is based  on  honesty.  The
registration  fee  you  pay  allows  me  to  support  and
continue to develop GSR in the future.

When  you  register  GSR you will  get  the  most  recent
registered version of the program, email support and  the
registered version help file along with constant  updates
about further developments in GSR and free upgrades.

Disclaimer

This  Product  is  distributed without  warranty,  either
expressed or implied.  No guarantee as to its suitability
for  a  particular  task is given.  No responsibility  is
assumed for any consequential loss or
damages arising from its use.

What is Shareware?

Shareware  is  the try it before you buy  it  concept  of
software marketing. It is freely available by downloading
it from various FTP sites, the Internet or one can easily
and  legally  give a copy to a friend. If  you  like  the
software  and  intend on continuing to use it  after  the
trial  period of typically 30 - 45 days, you are expected
to  register  the software with the author. Shareware  is
not  freeware. It's continued use implies that  it  is  a
viable  and  needed  tool.  Registration  encourages  the
author  to enhance the software's features, making  it  a
better  tool  for you the user, and also  to  create  new
software in the future.

Shareware  distribution  gives  users  a  chance  to  try
software before buying it. If you try a Shareware program
and  continue  using  it, you are expected  to  register.
Individual  programs differ on details  --  some  request
registration  while  others require it,  some  specify  a
maximum trial period. With registration, you get anything
from  the simple right to continue using the software  to
an updated program with printed manual.

Copyright  laws  apply to both Shareware  and  commercial
software,  and the copyright holder retains  all  rights,
with a few specific exceptions as stated below. Shareware
authors   are   accomplished   programmers,   just   like
commercial  authors, and the programs are  of  comparable
quality. (In both cases, there are good programs and  bad
ones!)   The  main  difference  is  in  the   method   of
distribution. The author specifically grants the right to
copy  and  distribute the software,  either  to  all  and
sundry  or to a specific group. For example, some authors
require  written  permission  before  a  commercial  disk
vendor may copy their Shareware.

Shareware  is  a  distribution  method,  not  a  type  of
software. You should find software that suits your  needs
and pocketbook, whether it's commercial or Shareware. The
Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because
you  can  try  it  before you buy  it.  And  because  the
overhead is low, prices are also low. Shareware  has  the
ultimate  money-back guarantee -- if you  don't  use  the
product, you don't pay for it.
